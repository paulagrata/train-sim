Train Station Simulator

You are to write a program to implement a railway travel simulation. This program should read input from a file and print the resulting score to the console. (The program should be a console-only program.) <br>The program should write no other output to the console. <br>The program should take a single command line parameter, the path of the input file. 

Passengers arrive at a set of stations with a destination station in mind. Trains travel on a regular schedule and have a fixed maximum capacity. The goal of the problem is to determine when all passengers arrive at their desired destination.
