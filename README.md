# train-sim
train station simulator

You are to write a program to implement a railway travel simulation. This program should read input  from a file and print the resulting score to the console. (The program should be a console-only program.)  The program should write no other output to the console. The program should take a single command  line parameter, the path of the input file. 


Passengers arrive at a set of stations with a destination station in mind. Trains travel on a regular  schedule and have a fixed maximum capacity. The goal of the problem is to determine when all  passengers arrive at their desired destination. 


One of the most important criteria for a successful solution is that it correctly solves the problem, but it  is also an opportunity for you to demonstrate your object-oriented knowledge and testing skills. We will  determine this by both code inspection and automated acceptance testing of the console output. We  will also be considering your overall approach to the problem and your programming style. This  assignment is an opportunity to show off your design, testing, and object-oriented skills.
